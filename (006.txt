#Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the givenformula:Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
#Following are the fixed values of C and H:C is 50. H is 30.D is the variable whose values should be input
# to your program in a commaseparated sequence.For example Let us assume the following commaseparated input
#sequence is given to the program:100,150,180The output of the program should be:18,22,24
